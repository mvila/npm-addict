        <p>It's been a great ride, but it's time to say goodbye. <a href='#'>npm addict</a> will be sunsetting on <strong>May 31st, 2023</strong>.</p>

        <p>The project began seven years ago and, unfortunately, has not undergone significant improvements since then. As a result, it has incurred numerous technical debts.</p>

        <p>Also, the operation cost has been rising gradually due to the significant increase in the number of npm packages released daily. Just to provide some insight, the database currently contains 67¬†GB of data, and the overall expense of hosting is roughly $100 per month.</p>

        <p>Regrettably, I cannot allocate sufficient time to address the technical debts or explore options to cover the expenses associated with hosting.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore, I've decided to close <a href='#'>npm addict</a> and genuinely apologize to the few people who use it.</p>
        
        <p>I still dedicate a significant portion of my time to working on open-source projects. For those who are interested, you can take a look at:</p>

        <p>I want to express my gratitude to all the individuals who have generously provided their assistance to me throughout the years. Thank you very much.¬†üôè</p>

        <p>Happy coding,<br />Manuel Vila</p>
